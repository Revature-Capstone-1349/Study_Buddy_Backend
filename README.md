# **The Annotations used for Java in IntelliJ**
   ### **@Autowired**
    Spring provides annotation-based auto-wiring by providing @Autowired annotation. It is used to autowire spring beans on setter methods, instance variables, and constructor. When we use @Autowired annotation, the spring container auto-wires the bean by matching data-type.
  ### **@AllArgsConstructor**
    Generates an all-args constructor. An all-args constructor requires one argument for every field in the class.
  ### **@RestController**
     It can be considered as a combination of @Controllerand @ResponseBody annotations. The @RestController annotation is itself annotated with the @ResponseBody annotation. It eliminates the need for annotating each method with @ResponseBody.
### **@Data**
     It is a convenient shortcut annotation that bundles the features of @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, @Getter / @Setter and @RequiredArgsConstructor together.
